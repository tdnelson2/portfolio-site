  "description": "This is the website I will use to showcase my work. ## Use To add different images, add them to `images_src`, edit `Gruntfile.js` with desired width, then run the `grunt` command within the folder. Repeat for each width. ## Future improvements * Add modals for each featured item to display additional information about each project * Create better images for the featured items * Experiment with overlaying a screen-effect pattern on the images in order to overcome the aliasing and loss of detail as the images scale * Add additional featured items for native code projects I've worked on in a separate section titled \"Native\"",
