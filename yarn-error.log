Repeat for each width. ## Future improvements * Add modals for each featured item to display additional information about each project * Create better images for the featured items * Experiment with overlaying a screen-effect pattern on the images in order to overcome the aliasing and loss of detail as the images scale * Add additional featured items for native code projects I've worked on in a separate section titled \"Native\"",
